  You will be give an elm module with types and you need to generate JSON encoders and decoders for them.
  Only output the new code that you generate.

  To build encoder and decoder you need the following imports:
  ```elm
  import Json.Decode as Decode exposing (Decoder)
  import Json.Encode as Encode exposing (Value)
  import Json.Decode.Extra as JDE
  ```

  Additionally, you need to import `Json.Encode.Extra` if you are using it:
  ```elm
  import Json.Encode.Extra as JEE
  ```
  Only add the imports if they are missing.

  Here is how to make a JSON decoder for a record:
  ```elm
  type alias Product =
      { name : String
      , price : Float
      }


  decoder : Decoder Product
  decoder =
    Decode.succeed Product
      |> JDE.andMap (Decode.field "name" Decode.string)
      |> JDE.andMap (Decode.field "price" Decode.float)
  ```

  Here is how to make a JSON encoder for a record:
  ```elm
  encode : Product -> Value
  encode product =
    Encode.object
      [ ( "name", Json.Encode.string product.name )
      , ( "price", Json.Encode.float product.price )
      ]
  ```

  Here is how to make a JSON decoder for a custom type (union type):
  ```elm
  type Shape
      = Circle Float
      | Rectangle Float Float

  decoder : Decoder Shape
  decoder =
    Decode.field "tag" Decode.string
      |> Decode.andThen
          (\tag ->
            case tag of
              "Circle" ->
                Decode.succeed Circle
                  |> JDE.andMap (Decode.field "radius" Decode.float)

              "Rectangle" ->
                Decode.succeed Rectangle
                  |> JDE.andMap (Decode.field "width" Decode.float)
                  |> JDE.andMap (Decode.field "height" Decode.float)

              _ ->
                Decode.fail ("Unknown constructor in Modulename.Shape: " ++ tag)
          )
  ```

  Here is how to make a JSON encoder for a custom type (union type):
  ```elm
  encode : Shape -> Value
  encode shape =
    case shape of
      Circle radius ->
        Encode.object
          [ ( "tag", Json.Encode.string "Circle" )
          , ( "radius", Json.Encode.float radius )
          ]

      Rectangle width height ->
        Encode.object
          [ ( "tag", Json.Encode.string "Rectangle" )
          , ( "width", Json.Encode.float width )
          , ( "height", Json.Encode.float height )
          ]
  ```

  Here is now to make a JSON encode/decoder for a tuple:
  ```elm
  encode : (Int, String) -> Value
  encode (x, y) =
    Encode.list [ Json.Encode.int x, Json.Encode.string y ]


  decoder : Decoder (Int, String)
  decoder =
    Decode.succeed Tuple.pair
        |> JDE.andMap (Decode.index 0 Decode.int)
        |> JDE.andMap (Decode.index 1 Decode.string)
  ```

  A Maybe type can be encoded/decoded by using `Json.Encode.Extra.maybe` and `Json.Decode.nullable`.

  A Result type can be encoded/decoded by using `Json.encodeResult` and `Json.decoderResult`. Import the module if it is missing by adding `import Json` to the imports.

  # Some facts

  # Naming conventions

  Use `decoder` and `encode` as function name when the type name matches the last part of the module name.
  The module name is always the first row of a file, eg `module Some.ModuleName exposing (..)`. Here, `Some.ModuleName` is the module name.

  If the type has a different name than the module name, use `decoder_Typename` and `encode_Typename` as the function names.
  If the type is found in another module you can expect `Typename.decoder` and `Typename.encode` to be available.

  Group the encoders and decoders by type with the encoder first and decoder second. Put a comment above the group using the following pattern: `-- ENCODE/DECODER for TypeName`.

  Put 2 empty lines between each function.
